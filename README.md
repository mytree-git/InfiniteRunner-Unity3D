# InfiniteRunner-Unity3D
“Infinite Runner” is a basic Unity 3D game where a player runs through an infinite world dodging hurdles and collecting points
The hurdles are of two types - a wall and a brick; jump over a brick or slide under a wall to save player's life.
The coins are of two types as well - gain 3 points for red coins and 5 points on collecting blue coins.
The timer will reset once the player dies.
