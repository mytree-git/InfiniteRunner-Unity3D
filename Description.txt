"Infinite Runner" is a Unity 3D game protototype made with C# language. In this game the 'hero' character keeps on running and bounces off the hurdles on its way.
The hurdles include vertical and horizontal wall slabs where the character slides or jumps respective to the type of the hurdle. 
There are also bonus collecting points in the path. The red coins earn 5 points and the blue coins earn 3 points to the player character.
Once the player hits any hurdle, the game stops and the score is set to 0.
